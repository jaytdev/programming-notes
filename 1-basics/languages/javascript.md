# JavaScript
Primitive types:
- Null
- Undefined
- Boolean
- Number
- String
- Symbol
- BigInt

And Objects and Functions!

Expressions are things that _express_ a value. The expression `2 + 2` expresses the value `4`.

`typeof(null)` lies and gives us `object`, but `null` is a primitive value. This is a bug.

- Primitive values are immutable.
- Variables are not values.
- Variables are like wires.
