# EC2

- Scalable virtual servers in the cloud.
- An EC2 virtual server is known as an **instance** and can be made up of different instance **types and sizes**.
- EC2 instances are composed of:
    - **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**: The operating system and other settings.
    - **Instance Type**: The hardware compute power, RAM, network bandwidth, etc.
    - **Network Interface**: Public, private, or elastic IP addresses.
    - **Storage**: The instance's "hard drive":
        - Elastic Block Store (EBS): Network persistent storage.
        - Elastic File System (EFS): Scalable, elastic file storage.
        - Instance Store: Ephemeral storage.
