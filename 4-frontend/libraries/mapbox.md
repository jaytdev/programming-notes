# Mapbox

## Basic Workflow

- Create a map with a chosen style
- Add a source
- Add layers which use that source

## Studio

- GeoJSON can be uploaded as either a **dataset** or a **tileset**
- A dataset must be no more than 5MB, but a tileset can be up to 1GB [(see here)](https://www.mapbox.com/help/uploads/#accepted-file-types-and-transfer-limits)
